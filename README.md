## Description
- I built a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database using Node.js, inquirer, and MySQL.

## Visuals
[Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UapvUinXIIYj_S7IaiBco6bUd-DKb187/view)

## Installation
For this you will need the following packages:
- MySQL 2 package
- Inquirer package
- console.table package
- You will need to run the schema and seeds in mysql after all the other packages are installed to start the database and populate it.

## Usage
- After installing all the necessary packages and loading the schema and seeds in mysql you will go back into the regular terminal and run node server.js to get the program started.
- When the program starts you will be met with an array of tasks that you can perform.
- After selecting a task you will be met with a question or questions to complete the task.
- Once those questions are finished the new data from the questions will be uploaded to the database in mysql.
